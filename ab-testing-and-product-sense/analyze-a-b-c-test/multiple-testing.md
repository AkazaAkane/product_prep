# Multiple Testing

Multiple comparisons arise when a statistical analysis involves multiple simultaneous statistical tests, each of which has a potential to produce a "discovery." A stated confidence level generally applies only to each test considered individually, but often it is desirable to have a confidence level for the whole family of simultaneous tests.

### Family-wise error rate (FWER)

FWER is appropriate when you want to guard against ANY false positives. However, in many cases (particularly in genomics) we can live with a certain number of false positives. In these cases, the more relevant quantity to control is the false discovery rate (FDR)
