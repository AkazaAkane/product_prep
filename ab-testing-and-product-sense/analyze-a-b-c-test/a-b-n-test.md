# A/B/n Test

* A/B/n and MVT tests are aimed at the same thing, increasing the number of conversions. But they differ in the object of testing. For example, A/B/n tests several variants of one content element, while MVT tests the effectiveness of combinations of different elements.
* It is reasonable to conduct MVT tests as an extension of A/B/n tests. A/B/n testing is conducted for global changes, while MVT testing is conducted for optimization.
* Both types of testing require a large amount of traffic, therefore the testing time can be increased. However, the result is worth it. All decisions on changes are made based on this data, not the opinions of marketers. This approach saves the team time in searching for compelling content and reduces the risks of errors.

### Advantages and disadvantages of A/B/n testing

#### Advantages

**Reducing the risks of financial losses.** For example, the easier it is for a customer to find the necessary product and place an order, the more likely they will buy from you. Conversely, inconspicuous buttons and unclear navigation lead to customer attrition and a loss of potential income.

**Increase in conversion.** Using this test, you will find the most clickable options that will lead your customers to purchase faster.

**Testing different ideas.** A marketing team can argue while developing a new design. Whose idea is better? Split testing will answer this question. It will test hypotheses and resolve the conflict peacefully.

**Increase in traffic.** It will happen if you reduce the Bounce Rate, which search engines take into account when ranking a website. A convenient landing page will delay users longer. This is a good sign for search engines. If users are interested, they stay on your website, which means this page can be shown more often.

**Resource-saving.** This test will show which options are working faster than arguing and testing one version of the content at a time.

**New ideas for future campaigns.** The behavior of users with different design options is a source of fresh, sometimes unexpected insights.

#### Disadvantages

**A large amount of traffic.** For regular A/B testing, the traffic is divided into two parts. For A/B/n testing, it is divided into several equal parts. Therefore, the results will be valid only if there is enough traffic for each option.

**Testing only one element.** The test will show which option is better (e.g., the dark button is clicked more often than the light one). Other factors that have influenced the result will remain unknown.

**Search engine sanctions.** Search engines may suspect you of cloaking (search spam when page options differ for the user and the search engine) when you conduct testing of the website design options.
