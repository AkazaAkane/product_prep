# Novelty Effect

### Novelty Effect <a href="#novelty-effect" id="novelty-effect"></a>

**Novelty Effect** happens when the engagement and interaction with one of your variations is substantially higher than previously, but only temporarily – giving you a false positive.

**Solution**

* Run your test for at least 4 weeks. In most cases, 4 weeks will be enough time to start seeing the novelty wear off and the test results begin to regulate.
* Keep tracking the winning variation's performance to ensure its long-term performance.
* [analyze session recordings](https://splitbase.com/blog/conversion-research-ecommerce/#Whatrsquos\_a\_session\_recording) and [run usability tests](https://splitbase.com/blog/conversion-research-ecommerce/#Method\_2\_User\_Testing) in order to understand the user behavior that’s happening on your site.
* Cohort analysis: _Segment your visitors into new and returning visitors and compare the conversion rates.‍_ If it’s just the Novelty Effect, the new offer will win with new visitors. Eventually, as returning visitors get accustomed to the new changes, the offer will win with them, too

### Ben Staples' Norstrom Method

At Nordstrom, we generally try to run our tests for two full weeks to see whether there is significantly different performance in week one versus week two.

When you are launching your test, make sure to ask yourself how external factors of seasonality might impact your test and increase the impact of the Novelty Effect. (dont run on blackfriday)

Looking at different customer cohorts: new users vs old users, High LTV vs Low LTV, More Frequent User vs Less Frequent User
