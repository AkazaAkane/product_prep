# Multivariate testing

**Common uses**

The most commonly cited example of multivariate testing is a page on which several elements are up for debate — for example, a page that includes a sign-up form, some kind of catchy header text, and a footer. To run a multivariate test on this page, rather than creating a radically different design as in A/B testing, you might create two different lengths of sign-up forms, three different headlines, and two footers. Next, you would funnel visitors to all possible combinations of these elements. This is also known as full factorial testing, and is one of the reasons why multivariate testing is often recommended only for sites that have a substantial amount of daily traffic — the more variations that need to be tested, the longer it takes to obtain meaningful data from the test.

After the test has been run, the variables on each page variation are compared to each other, and to their performance in the context of other versions of the test. What emerges is a clear picture of which page is best performing, and which elements are most responsible for this performance. For example, varying a page footer may be shown to have very little effect on the performance of the page, while varying the length of the sign-up form has a huge impact.

**Advantages**

Multivariate testing is a powerful way to help you target redesign efforts to the elements of your page where they will have the most impact. This is especially useful when designing landing page campaigns, for example, as the data about the impact of a certain element's design can be applied to future campaigns, even if the context of the element has changed.

**Limitations**

The single biggest limitation of multivariate testing is the amount of traffic needed to complete the test. Since all experiments are fully factorial, too many changing elements at once can quickly add up to a very large number of possible combinations that must be tested. Even a site with fairly high traffic might have trouble completing a test with more than 25 combinations in a feasible amount of time.

When using multivariate tests, it's also important to consider how they will fit into your cycle of testing and redesign as a whole. Even when you are armed with information about the impact of a particular element, you may want to do additional A/B testing cycles to explore other radically different ideas. Also, sometimes it may not be worth the extra time necessary to run a full multivariate test when several well-designed A/B tests will do the job well.
